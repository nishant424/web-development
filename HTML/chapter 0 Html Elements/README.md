<table>
<tr>
<td width=450> 

<a href="#"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63545175/152875163-ffbb5fdd-5aed-4463-8324-b037c5910c53.png" width="420px"></a>
</td>
<td>

**Block Elements:**
<br/>Takes up the full width available, and force a line break (before and after it).
```
  Ex: <div>,<p>,<h1>‚Ä¶<h6>,<ul>,<li>,<table>
```


**Inline Elements:**
<br/>Takes up only as much width as necessary, and does not force any line break.
```
Ex: <span>, <a></a>, <img>, <iframe>
```
  
</td>
</tr>
</table>

***note:*** You can nest inline elements inside block elements but not the other way around.

***tip:*** The most important block element in HTML is the division element ``(<div></div>)``. This element is heavily used and sometimes whole websites or web apps only consist of divisions. The division forces a line break and is often used as a container of other divisions or other HTML elements.
<br/>The counterpart to division is the inline element ``(<span></span>)``. As we learned, inline elements don‚Äôt force a line break and hence, divide the content into logical parts.

***tip:*** div and span are non-semantic tags, but their amazing application is  use ‚Äúthey are used for structuring the html document‚Äù.

***tip:*** ‚Äú in html5 block elements are roughly flow elements, and inline elements are roughly phrasing elements. ‚Äù
