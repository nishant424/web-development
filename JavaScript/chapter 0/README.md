# ways to add JavaScript to your html file 

## internal JavaScript:
```html
<head>
    <! ‚Äì‚Äì inside head ‚Äì‚Äì>		
    <script language="JavaScript" type="text/JavaScript">
            // JavaScript code
    </script>
</head>
<body>

    <! ‚Äì‚Äì inside body ‚Äì‚Äì>
    <script>
		/* JavaScript code */
    </script>
</body>
```

<br>

***tip1:*** _it is recommended to include javascript only at the end inside body element, because elements must be rendered before execution of javascript._
<br/> ***tip2:*** _another way to overcome the error, below code can put inside head or anywhere inside body and it must work perfectly._
```html
<script>
	document.addEventListner(‚ÄúDOMContentLoaded‚Äù, function() {
		/*javascript code/functionality/statements that we need */
	});
</script>
```
***tip3:*** _in case of external javascript file we can use an attribute called defer, The defer is a Boolean value, used to indicate that script is executed after the document has been parsed. It works only with external scripts._
```html
<script src="script.js" language="JavaScript" type="text/javaScript" defer></script>
```

- **async** and **defer** both instruct the browser to download the script(s) in a separate thread, while the rest of the page (the DOM, etc.) is downloading, so the page loading is not blocked by the scripts.

- If your scripts should be run immediately and they don't have any dependencies, then use ***``async``***.

- If your scripts need to wait for parsing and depend on other scripts and/or the DOM being in place, load them using ***``defer``*** and put their corresponding <script> elements in the order you want the browser to execute them.
