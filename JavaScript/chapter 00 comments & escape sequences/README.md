## Escape sequences in string literals: 
_The backslash character (/) has a special purpose in JavaScript strings. Combining this with the character that follows it, it represents a character that is not otherwise represented within the strings, just like in C++._
<br/>***ex: \b is for backspace and \n is for newline.***

|Code  |	Result             |
|------|---------------------|
|``\b``|	Backspace          |
|``\f``|	Form Feed          |
|``\n``|	New Line           |
|``\r``|	Carriage Return    |
|``\t``|	Horizontal Tabulator|
|``\v``|	Vertical Tabulator  |
|``\'``|	Single quote       |
|``\"``|	Double quote       |
