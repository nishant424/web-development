## JavaScript Statements:

 although it is not necessary to use <b>‚Äú ; ‚Äù</b> for single line statements but it is always recommended to always end statements with a semi-colon <b>‚Äú ; ‚Äù</b>.

<br/>


## equality and strict equality

== is used for comparing two variables, but it ignores the datatype of variable. 
type coercion still happens with regular (==) equality. i.e, at first it implicitly converts (type coercion) datatype of one variable to match that of another. then compares the variables. 

=== is used for comparing two variables, but this operator also checks datatype and then compares two values. 
Strict (===) prevents type coercion. i.e, this strict comparison operator compares data in its original form. 

<b>example:</b>
```js
if (4 == ‚Äú4‚Äù)		//returns true
if (4 === ‚Äú4‚Äù) 		//returns false
```

<br/>


## Boolean true and false:
```js
- 0, null, NaN, undefined, ‚Äú‚Äù , false,		<---------they all coerce to being false.

- true, ‚ÄúHello‚Äù, 1, -1, ‚Äúfalse‚Äù	 		<---------they all coerce to being true.
```


<br/>


## Conditional Statements:
### ‚ãÖ	if else if
```js
if (expression)
	statements;
else if (expression2)
	{statements;}
else{statements;}
tip: don‚Äôt forget false && false evaluate to false.
```

<br/>


### ternary operator
```js
var ans = conditional ? (if condition is true) : (if condition is false);
```


<br/>


<br/>



## Compound Statement:
<b>A compound statement is any number and kind of statement grouped together within curly braces. {}</b>
we group multiple statements in a block together so that we can use it (compound statement) where java expects only one statement.

<b>ex:</b>
```js
if (true) true;		// this statement is valid since if is expecting only one statement.
```

<b>but if you want to write multiple statements in place of this true if (true) true; you can only do that by using a compound statement.</b>

<b>ex:</b>
```js
if (true) {
	console.log(‚Äúhello!‚Äù);
	console.log(‚Äúisn‚Äôt it awesome‚Äù);
	prompt(‚Äúwhat do you say‚Äù)
}	// using a compound statement
```


<br/>


<br/>


## Shadowing:
Variable shadowing occurs <b>when a variable of an inner scope is defined with the same name as a variable in the outer scope.</b> In the inner scope, both variables' scope overlap, and the inner shadows outer.

To avoid shadowing, the variable in the function scope should be <b>declared using the var keyword</b> so that it becomes accessible to the function only.

Illegal Shadowing: <b>while shadowing a variable, it should not cross the boundary of the scope</b>, i.e. we can shadow var variable by let variable but cannot do the opposite.

<b>output:</b> 4 
  
<b>tip:</b>  The variable x is declared in the global scope and used throughout the entire snippet of code. the global variable x is assigned the value of 1.
Then, the function addTwo() increments the variable by 2.
Next, the variable is incremented by 1.
Finally, it's printed out using console.log

  
</td>  
<td>
  
<b>output:</b> 2
  
<b>tip:</b> Here, there are two x variables, one in the global scope and one inside the addTwo() function scope. The global variable x is incremented by 1. Since the global variable's original value was 1, and it was incremented by 1, console.log will print out 2.
The variable assignment inside the function addTwo() only has function scope, so its affect is not reflected outside the function.

<b><em>imp summary:</em></b>
- If an identifier is declared in global scope, it's available everywhere.
- If an identifier is declared in function scope, it's available in the function it was declared in (even if function is declared inside the function).

## switch case statement:
```js  
var expression = prompt (‚Äúenter your choice‚Äù);
switch (expression){
	case value1:
		statements;
		break;
	case value2:
		statements;
		break;
	default:
		statements;
}
```
  
> <b>note: üìù</b> if you don‚Äôt use break then every case after the switched case will also get executed, sometimes that is also useful.

<br/>  
  
  
## Loops (for loop, while loop, for Each loop):
- always make sure you have all 3 start , stop, step coditions.
<b>while:</b>
```js
while (expression){
	statements;
}
``` 
  
<b>do while:</b>
```
do {
	statements;
} while(expression);
```

> <b>note: üìù</b> In do while, Note the semicolon used at the end of the do...while loop. This is important.

  
<br/>
  
  
<br/>  
  
  
  
## for loop 	- loops through a block of code a number of times
```js  
for (initialization; condition; updation;){
    statements;
  }
```
  
- initialization statement is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
- condition statement defines the condition for executing the code block.
- updation statement is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.


### for/in 	- loops through the properties of an object
```js  
for (key in object) {		// each can 	be key or value
    statements;
}
```
  
  
### for/of 		- loops through the values of an iterable object
```js  
for (each of object) {
        statements;
}
```
